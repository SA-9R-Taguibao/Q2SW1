        </th>
          </td>
        <td>Pink is the main protagonist of The Wall. He is a depressed rockstar wanting to isolate himself by building a mental wall. Every of his traumatic memories are represented as bricks. He then explores through hardships of being socially isolated. Therefore, his experiences drove him so crazy, that it was time to finally demolish his mental wall.</td>
        <td>He represents the former bandmate of Pink Floyd, Syd Barrett, who started playing with Pink Floyd from 1967 until 1968. He became super tired of performing with the band, due to the fame they get and the music industry. So, he slowly progresses to become mentally insane, just like Pink. He also represents Roger Waters after a tour in Montreal when a fan was being too rowdy, so he spat on the fan, and became distant with his audience, like being divided by a wall, just as how Pink did.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Pink's Mother</td>

        </th>
      </td>
        <td>Pink's overprotective Mother is one of the pivotal roles of the story, which involves her helping Pink build his mental wall to protect himself from every danger due to her overprotectiveness</td>
        <td>In my opinion, it represents people who seek help and support from their parents through tough moments. But sometimes, when they are too overprotective, they could cause a little harm, such as that of isolating yourself to prevent any harm. While that sounds okay, you could descend yourself to madness.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>J.A Pinkerton</td>

        <td>This is Pink's Father. During a flashback, he remembers about his father dying amidst fighting in the Battle of Anzio when World War 2 was still happening. The death of his father completely impacted him, which is another traumatic memory, represented as bricks.</td>
        <td>It represents the father of the band's bassist, Roger Waters, who also died during the Battle of Anzio. He paid tribute to his father in songs like, "When the Tigers Broke Free" from the 1983 album, The Final Cut.</td>

        <td>Pink's teacher when he was young. He is also one of the pivotal roles of the story. He would give out severe punishment to his students when they are "disruptive", because his wife would usually also do that to him, thus putting the schoolmaster under the influence. Pink imagines his teacher as a lunatic who would totally crush the students under his own weight.</td>
        <td>He represents the strict and rigid teachers in boarding schools, as mentioned in the hit song, "Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2"</td>
      </tr>

          <td>This is the final character mentioned in The Wall, and it's one of the pivotal roles of the resolution of the story. When Pink realized all the troubles he have done with the wall around him, so he puts himself on trial for showing "feelings of an almost human nature". His sentence was demolishing his mental wall, so he can finally go to the outside world again.</td>
          <td>I feel that this character doesn't have a representation, as it's Pink's mind coming up with all the things going on.</td>
